Analytics Automated
===================

Analytics Automated is a lightweight framework for configuring pipelines
of data processing tasks which users can call as webservices. It is targeted
principally at running statistical and mathematical models for the purposes of
Data Science. You can however use it to convert any code in to a web service.

Another way to look at it is that it turns your data analysis pipelines in to
RESTful web services for the purposes making your models part of your SOA.

And yet another way to look at this is a method for converting Python-Celery
jobs in to web services
